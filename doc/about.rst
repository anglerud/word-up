About Word Up
=============

Word Up is a very simple set of scripts designed to be as simple
as possible to use when backing up a wordpress site. It requires
no configuration, apart from selecting the directory that your
wordpress instance is installed in, and the directory you want
to save your backups in. 

It will back up the files that are custom to your site, your config,
the database and store them in a zip file. 

Ideally you'll want to schedule backups via cron, for hassle-free
peace of mind.
