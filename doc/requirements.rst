Requirements
============
In addition to python (version 2.7), you'll need the following additional
python modules: 

 * argparse
 * fs
 * filepath

You can install of these using 'pip'. I suggest installing these in a new
virtual env, so that you can be certain updates or changes don't 
risk breaking your backup setup.
